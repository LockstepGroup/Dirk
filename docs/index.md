# Dirk (as in Gently)

Dirk was originally written to get data from LiquidWareLabs and send it to an SQL Database for use with Tableau Dashboards. It was called LTGReport back then. Shortly into the development, we realized it didn't need to be limited to LWL or SQL. In it's current form it retrieves data from a number of sources (Plugins), and sends it to a number of destination (Outputs).

Everything is connected.
